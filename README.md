# Word Count

This program counts the number of unigrams and bigrams in a text file. It is useful for getting a quick list of all possible words and their frequencies in order to understand the statistics of a text file.

Features include:
* Getting a changelog file for nonalphanumeric words in a text file
* Getting the longest word in a text file
* Searching for unigrams and bigrams
* Saving a list of all unigrams and bigrams along with their frequencies
* Indexing unigrams and bigrams

How to use:
1. Download and navigate to the directory for these files
2. Open the terminal and type `make`
3. Type `./output` to run the program
4. Type `make clean` to remove the compiled files

This program requires [MinGW](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html "Download MinGW from https://nuwen.net") to run on Windows. Install on the main drive and add it to the PATH.
